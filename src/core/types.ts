 *  - a counter remainder modulo `modulus` (the rotation/wrap counter)
 *  - an integer closed time interval [timeLower, timeUpper] during which
 *    the packet was actually transmitted
 *
 * The service jointly assigns every packet:
 *  - a distinct absolute counter, congruent to its remainder modulo modulus,
 *    inside the absolute-count search window
 *  - an integer transmit timestamp inside its closed interval
